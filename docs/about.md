# About

Hey, my name's Joe. I'm a web developer and football (...*soccer*) fan. Like many other web developers, I like to start a new side project a couple of times a week. One of these side projects I decided I wanted to build was a dashboard to browse historic data results. I've always loved the fun statistics that sports commentators come out with:

> Well Liverpool have a dangerous 2-1 lead here away at Middlesbrough. The last time Liverpool were leading at half time against a team beginning with the letter 'M', and went on to lose, was April 1998. The referee that day was called Jeremy, which funnily enough is the name of today's match official!

So I went out to find a free API that I could use, and came up trumps. So I thought I'd try building my own.

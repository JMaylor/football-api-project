## Introduction

Hey, my name's Joe Maylor. I'm a web developer from the UK, and big football fan. Like many other web developers, I like to start a new side project a couple of times a week. One of these side projects I decided I wanted to build was a dashboard to browse historic data results. I've always loved the fun statistics that sports commentators come out with:

> Liverpool go in at the break with a 2-1 lead here away at Middlesbrough. The last time Liverpool lead at half time against a team beginning with the letter 'M' and went on to lose, was April 1998. The referee that day was called Jeremy, which funnily enough is the name of today's match official!

I dreamed of making a web app that would help me come up with my own stats like that. While I didn't end up building the next Opta (yet), I did managed to build something. This blog is about how I went about it.

## Data

The beating heart of this project is clearly the data. Without that, I had nothing. Unfortunately, I need my 9-5 to pay the bills, so manually watching old games and inputting data myself was off the table. Instead, I had to find some data that already existed. I ended up finding the brilliant [football-data.co.uk](https://www.football-data.co.uk/data.php), which has a lot of CSV files available for download for a variety of leagues, going back nearly 30 years. This looked like a great data source.
